# Store project

This is the biggest project I developed so far and this envolves an desktop application for a store inventory control. 

I'm planning on doing a Website in React for this project and a proper nodeJS API for the project, but i have no future plans on upgrading the desktop app to connect to the api because it wouldn't be worth it since it was made without planning real time updates and therefore not supporting communication between nodes in real time.
But there are still some plans on upgrading the desktop app performance by limiting the amount of products being showed in the main area, changing the renderization process so it doesn't load all at once and updating only the affected products instead of updating the whole list. These changes should increase the performance by a lot and should be implemented as soon as possible.
